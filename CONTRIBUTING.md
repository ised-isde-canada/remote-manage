Contributing
------------

1. File an issue to notify the maintainers about what you're working on. We may already be working on it.
2. Fork the repo, develop and test your code changes, add docs.
3. Make sure that your commit messages clearly describe the changes.
4. Send a pull request.

File an Issue
-------------

Use the issue tracker to start the discussion. It is possible that someone else is already working on your idea, your approach is not quite right, or that the functionality exists already. The ticket you file in the issue tracker will be used to hash that all out.

Keep in mind that the maintainers get final say on whether new features will be integrated into the project.

Style Guides
------------
1. Write in UTF-8 in PHP 7.3 and 7.4.
2. Please follow the [PHP Standards Recommendations](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/)).
3. Fully test your code with full debugging enabled. Ensure that there are no errors or warnings at all.
4. Test your code. Ensure that there are no errors or warnings at all.
5. Look at the existing style and adhere accordingly.

Fork the Repository
-------------------

Be sure to add the relevant tests before making the pull request. The documentation will be updated automatically when we merge to `master`, but you should also build the documentation yourself and make sure it is readable.

Make a Pull Request
-------------------

Once you have made all your changes, tested, updated the documentation and rebased your code with master, make a pull request to merge your changes back into the main branch of the `repository`. Be sure to reference the original issue in the pull request. Expect some back-and-forth with regards to style and compliance of these rules.

Versioning
----------
We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning and tagging.
